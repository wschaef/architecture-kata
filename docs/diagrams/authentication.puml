participant User as user
participant Device as device
participant "Backend for Frontend \n BFF" as bff
participant "internal IDP" as IDP1
participant "3rd party IDP" as IDP2


=== confidential client authentication flow ==

user -> device: triggers login 
group bff code flow with internal IDP
    device -> bff: login
    device <- bff: redirect to internal IDP
    device -> IDP1:  authorization code request to /authorize
    device <- IDP1: Username input page (identifier first pattern)
    user <- device: Ask for username input
    user -> device: Enter username
    device -> IDP1: username
    IDP1 -> IDP1: derive the 3rd party IDP from username
    group internal IDP code flow with 3rd party IDP
        device <- IDP1: redirect to 3rd party IDP (including username as login_hint)
        device -> IDP2: authorization code request to /authorize
        device <- IDP2: Credential input page
        user <- device: Ask for credential input
        user -> device: enter credentials
        device -> IDP2: credentials
        IDP2 -> IDP2: check credentials
        device <- IDP2: redirect with authorization code (from 3rd party for internal)
        device -> IDP1: redirect_uri
        IDP1 -> IDP2: get tokens with authorization code
        IDP1 <- IDP2: tokens
    end group
    IDP1 -> IDP1: map 3rd party tokens to internal tokens
    device <- IDP1: redirect with authorization code (from internal for bff)
    device -> bff: redirect_uri
    bff -> IDP1: get tokens
    bff <- IDP1: tokens (from internal)
end group
bff -> bff: save tokens in user session
bff -> device: starting page or requested page
