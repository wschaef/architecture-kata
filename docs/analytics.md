# My thoughts about the analytical space

## Requirements

- partner agencies would like to have an aggregated view about all available travel data of their customers
- social media integration [FR7]: Users should also be able to share their trip information by interfacing with standard social media sites or allowing targeted people to view your trip.
- [FR6] - Items in the dashboard should be able to be grouped by trip, and once the trip is complete, the items should automatically be removed
- [FR3] - Filter and whitelist certain emails

Travel information which can be assumed:

- travel specific combination of hotel, traffic medium (flight, train, Taxi what ever is available ), durations, destinations
- partner might want to correlate

## Intelligent Email parser

Connects to email server, fetches the emails, and extracts the data.

NLP technologies and techniques in a coherent pipeline can enable effective information extraction from travel-related emails.

The choice of methods and tools may vary depending on the complexity of the task and the volume of email data to be processed. (no infos yet) Additionally, integrating email parsing and NLP into travel automation can streamline the extraction and utilization of business information from emails.

## sperate anylyitical stack vs enrichment

Coming from a start-up situation and a MVP process with quick time2market we have to assume application-driven analytics. There are now data platforms that bring together operational and analytical workloads into one (avoid data duplication, lot's of integration works, flexibility to adopt).
