## Solution Strategy

The solution strategy for the Road Warrior Travel Management Dashboard focuses on simplifying integration with external systems, prioritizing core features for the MVP, and leveraging cloud services for cost-effectiveness. By adopting Agile development methodologies, the project aims to ensure iterative progress, flexibility, and improved collaboration between the team and stakeholders. This approach balances efficient development with adaptability, allowing the platform to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience for managing travel plans.

1. **Implement email forwarding functionality** instead of direct integration with Email Providers. Users can forward their travel-related emails to a specific email address provided by the platform. This will simplify the initial development and reduce the complexity of integrating with various email providers.

2. **Utilize public Identity Providers (IDPs) for user authentication** (as per ADR2). This will allow users to log in using popular services like Google or Facebook, reducing the need for a custom authentication system and simplifying the onboarding process.

3. **Exclude analytics and reporting features from the MVP scope**. Focus on the core functionality of trip organization and management, which will allow for faster development and testing of the essential features of the platform.

4. **Integrate only with Travel Systems** (such as SABRE, APOLLO) for retrieving travel information, and skip direct integration with hotels, car rentals, and airlines. This will streamline the development process and allow the platform to focus on a single integration point for travel data.

5. **Leverage native services in the public cloud (XaaS)** instead of building custom solutions. Utilize cloud-based infrastructure, databases, and other services to reduce development time, maintenance efforts, and costs.

6. **Research and adopt industry standards and best practices** for each component of the platform. This will ensure a high level of interoperability, reliability, and maintainability of the system.

7. **Adopt Agile development methodologies** to ensure iterative progress, flexibility, and better collaboration between the development team and stakeholders. Implement practices such as product backlog management, sprints, daily stand-ups, continuous integration, code reviews, testing, and sprint retrospectives to continuously refine the project based on feedback and learnings from each sprint.

### Motivation

In the context of our architecture, the decision to split our solution into several domains stems from a fundamental understanding of the necessary functionality and a keen consideration of various non-functional requirements. By dissecting our system into distinct domains and components, we embark on a journey to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency in our development process. 

#### Function analyses

In our pursuit of an optimized and well-structured solution, we turn our attention to the deliberate division of functionality, specifically the distribution of Use Cases across our distinct domains. 

By meticulously organizing an independent set of Use Cases within each domain, we not only foster a more agile and self-contained development process but also reduce the inherent complexities associated with interdependencies

In more formal terminology, this strategic approach directly contributes to the enhancement of 'Loose coupling' and 'Cohesion' within our system, reinforcing the foundational principles that guide our architectural choices

As you can see in table: we have very high independent domains.

_Remark: In "Channel domain" we mentioned list of Use cases, but only UI part of these US is related to Channel domain._

#### Architecture characteristics
Even all Architecture characteristics should be taking in account when we design and implement domains, some of Architecture characteristics played more important role and influence significantly on component design and deployment.

| quality attributes | Analytic | Configuration | Channel | Trip organizer | IAM    | Integration |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| availability       | medium   | medium        | High    | High           | High   | High        |
| compatibility      | High     | low           | low     | low            | High   | High        |
| evolvability       | High     | low           | High    | high           | low    | medium      |
| localizability     | low      | low           | high    | high           | low    | medium      |
| testability        | low      | low           | high    | high           | medium | medium      |
| traceability       | high     | low           | low     | medium         | high   | high        |

Based on this analyses we can see that all domains has different Architecture characteristics and as result we are not able to combine them.

#### Contained Building Blocks

*\<Description of contained building block (black boxes)>*

**Analytic domain** - responsible for collect data for reports, create reports and provide access to reports. This domain has persistent data like raw analytical data and generated reports.

Cross domain interfaces:

- Analytic domain delivery end-of-year reports Channel domain.
- Analytic domain recieve  notification directly from Integration domain in order to have actual information in Analytic domain and also it allow as to analyse behaviour of Agencies. (for example how often Deutsche Bahn delayed his train)
- Analytic domain read data from Trip Organizer domain to collect information about Trips and Reservation

Reason: This domain is separated because from strategic point of view it can be purschased from third party.
Most of non functional requirments for this domain don't clear in the beginning of project, because no clear view how we can use collected analytic data which metrics we need to collect. But generation "end-of year" report requires hight elasticity at the end of calendar year.  

**Configuration domain** - responsible for manage configuraiton mailbox for polling and definitions for filters and whitelist.

Cross domain interfaces:

- User able to change configuration for Whitelist/filters and mailboxes via Channel Domain.
- Integration domain used configuration from Configuration domain.

Reason: This domain one of simples one and we don't expect high performance requirements and many changes during project evolution. 

**Trip organizer domain** - allow use to manage his trips, create new one, delete and add reservations to this trips.
Data ingested from integration domain.

Cross domain interfaces:

- Integration domain send all notification about changes in reservation to Trip Organizer in order to have actual information in trip repository.
- Trip organizer send notification about changes in reservations to Channel domain in order to delivery it to end-user with minimum delays. (Channel domain can use websocket or iOS/Android notification service to delivery notification to clients)
- Trip organizer domain provide API for client applications (Channel domain) to get information about trips and reservation.
- Trip organizer read detailed data about reservation via Integration domain from Travel systems and Agencies.
- Trip organizer provide data to Analytic domain about trips and reservations.
  
Reason: It is core of our business and our differention from our competitors. We need very high evolvalibity for component in this area. And is we store customer data here this components has dedicated security level and personal data should be protected.

**Channel domain** - responsibe for providing user interfaces like web-application and mobile applications.

Cross domain interfaces:

- Channel domain recieve all notification about changes in reservation to Trip Organizer and update content in user interfaces.
- Channel domain use API of Trip Organizer in order to get information about trips and reservation.
- Channel domain use IAM for register and login user (token exchange)
- Channel domain recieve end-of-year report from Analytic domain
- Channel domain provide configuration to Configuration domain

Reason: This domain is our "face" to end-user and we have very high requirement for quality in this area (testability) and also high level of evolvalibity. This domain is critical from UX perspecitve and we expect that we will have a lot changes and they should be delivered to user asap. 

**IAM domain** - covers all aspect of registration, authentication and authorization user.
In order simplify diagram only interaction with Channel domain displayed. Other like Analytic and Trip Organizer also integrated with IAM in order to validate OpenID tokens and access rights.

Cross domain interfaces:

- IAM domain cover regiteration and login process for Channel (token exchange)
- IAM domain used by Channel, Analytic and Trip Organizer domain for token validaion (not shown on diagram)

Reason: It is standard pattern to have IAM as separate domain, because this domain already well developed and not depend of business specific of project. Also in most case we can reuse existing out-of-box solutions with minum configuration and customisation.

**Integration domain** - provide capabilities for collect information from external sources like emailboxes, external travel systems and agancies. Several components included in domain:

Cross domain interfaces:

- Integration domain sent  notification directly to Analytic domain in order to have actual information in Analytic domain
and also it allow as to analyse behaviour of Agencies. (for example how often Deutsche Bahn delayed his train)
- Integration domain use configuration from Configuration domain.
- Integration domain provide detailed data about reservation via Integration domain from Travel systems and Agencies to Trip Organizer domain
- Integration domain sent notification directly to Trip Organizer domain in order to update reservations and inform users. 

Reason: This domain is our door to external Travel world, and we need to organize all integration in very similar way in order to reduce data model aligment in other domains. We expect very hight load on this component, becuase 2 mln active will add new reservations in system and we need to request external partners for details about this reservation. Also we expect that all active reservaion (in active trips) can recieve updates via Travel systems, emails or from agencies.
